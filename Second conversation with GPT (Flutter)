I would like to create an app in which you can message GOD. There will be no automated answer. I want the interface to look like a messaging app. I want to be able to see past entries. I want it to have smooth and professional UI and colors. 
You will need to consider several things when building an app like this:

Design: You should design the interface of your app to look like a messaging app, and choose the color scheme, typography, and other design elements accordingly.

Database: You will need to set up a database to store all the messages that users send to "GOD." You will also need to ensure that the database is secure and that users' privacy is protected.

User authentication: You will need to implement user authentication so that only registered users can use the app.

Backend: You will need to develop a backend to handle the sending and receiving of messages, as well as storing and retrieving messages from the database.

UI and UX: You will need to focus on creating a smooth and professional user experience, making sure that the app is easy to use and navigate.

Testing: You will need to thoroughly test your app to make sure it's functioning as expected and that there are no bugs or glitches.

Overall, creating an app like this is a complex project that requires a good understanding of app development, UI/UX design, and database management. You may want to consider working with a professional app development company or hiring a team of developers to help you build your app.

How would I make a simple version of this app on my own with limited coding knowledge?
Here's a simple approach you can follow to build a basic version of this app on your own with limited coding knowledge:

Choose a platform: You can use a low-code app builder platform such as Thunkable, Appy Pie, or BuildFire to create your app. These platforms allow you to create an app without having to write any code.

Design the interface: Use the app builder platform to design the interface of your app. You can create a messaging interface that looks like a chat window, with an input field for users to type their messages and a display area to show past entries.

Add storage: Add a database to store the messages that users send to "GOD." You can use a cloud-based database such as Firebase, which is easy to set up and use.

Add user authentication: You can add user authentication using the built-in features of your app builder platform or using a third-party service such as Firebase Authentication.

Test the app: Test your app to make sure it's working as expected and that there are no bugs or glitches. You can also get feedback from friends and family to improve the app further.

Note that this approach will result in a basic version of the app, and you may not be able to add advanced features such as push notifications or in-app purchases. However, it can be a good starting point for you to learn about app development and gain more experience.

are any of those platforms free?
Yes, some of the app builder platforms that I mentioned in my previous answer have free versions with limited features. Here's a summary of the free versions of each platform:

Thunkable: Thunkable has a free version with limited features. You can use the free version to build and test your app, but you'll need to upgrade to a paid plan to publish your app and access advanced features.

Appy Pie: Appy Pie has a free version that allows you to build an app and publish it to the App Store or Google Play. However, you'll need to upgrade to a paid plan to access advanced features such as push notifications, in-app purchases, and more.

BuildFire: BuildFire has a free trial that lasts for 14 days. During the trial, you can use all the features of the platform to build and test your app. After the trial, you'll need to upgrade to a paid plan to continue using the platform.

Keep in mind that even with the free versions of these platforms, you may still need to pay for certain things such as hosting and domain name. Additionally, the free versions of these platforms often have limitations on the number of users, storage, and other features.

according to the appypie website their cheapest plan is 16 dollards a month
Yes, that's correct. The pricing for Appy Pie starts at $16 per month for the Basic plan, which includes features such as app building, hosting, and basic support. However, this price may change and it's always a good idea to check the latest pricing information on their website.

It's also worth mentioning that other app builder platforms may have different pricing structures and that there may be other free or low-cost options available. I would recommend doing your own research and comparing the different platforms to find the one that best fits your needs and budget.

How do I add a text input that shows a chat bubble output in flutterflow?

Here's how you can add a text input and a chat bubble output in Flutterflow:

Create a new Flutterflow project: Start by creating a new project in Flutterflow. You can choose the Blank app template to start with a blank canvas.

Add a text input: In Flutterflow, you can add a text input by using the TextField widget. You can add this widget to your app using the Widget Library on the right side of the screen. Simply drag and drop the TextField widget onto the canvas.

Add a chat bubble output: To add a chat bubble output, you can use the Container widget to create a bubble shape. You can add text to the container using the Text widget. To make it look like a chat bubble, you can add a background color, set rounded corners, and add a border.

Connect the widgets: In Flutterflow, you can connect the widgets to create a dynamic user interface. To do this, you'll need to bind the value of the TextField widget to a variable. Then, you can use the variable to display the text in the chat bubble.

Test the app: After connecting the widgets, you can preview your app by clicking the Preview button. You should now be able to type text into the text input, and the chat bubble should show the output.

This is just a basic example of how you can add a text input and a chat bubble output in Flutterflow. You can customize and extend the app by adding more widgets and features as needed.

can you explain step 3 more
Sure, I can explain step 3 in more detail.

To create a chat bubble output in Flutter, you can use the Container widget to create a rectangular area and then add a border and background color to make it look like a chat bubble. Here's an example:

less
Copy code
Container(
  padding: EdgeInsets.all(10),
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    color: Colors.lightBlue,
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(15),
  ),
  child: Text(
    'Hello World',
    style: TextStyle(
      fontSize: 18,
      color: Colors.white,
    ),
  ),
)
In this example, the Container widget has the following properties:

padding: Adds padding inside the container to separate the text from the border.
decoration: Specifies the background color and border radius of the container. The border radius makes the container corners rounded, giving it a chat bubble appearance.
child: Contains the text that will be displayed inside the container. The text is created using the Text widget and styled with a font size and color.
By using the Container widget in this way, you can create a chat bubble output that you can display in your Flutter app. Of course, you can customize this example to fit your needs, such as changing the background color, text color, border radius, and more.
